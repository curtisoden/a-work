## Repository Structure

- **SOURCE_client_data.csv**
  Client source data file

- **SOURCE_price_data.csv** 
  Price source data file

- **DATA_v4_churn.csv**  
  The primary dataset used for churn modeling. Contains customer features and churn labels. (automatically generated by the notebook)

  - **SAMPLE_v4_churn.csv**
    Trunacted version of the primary dataset used for exploration. (automatically generated by the notebook)

- **001_v4_end_to_end_churn_modeling_workflow.ipynb**  
  The main Jupyter notebook for the end-to-end churn modeling workflow. This notebook includes all data preparation, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and business insights for churn prediction.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Run the Main Churn Modeling Workflow**  
   Open `001_v4_end_to_end_churn_modeling_workflow.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code. Follow the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the full churn modeling pipeline, from data loading to model evaluation and business recommendations.

2. **Generate Reports**  
   Use `002_v4_generate_doc.ipynb` to convert the main notebook into a Word, HTML, PDF, or Markdown report. Run the notebook and follow the prompts. Ensure you have Jupyter and nbconvert installed.

3. **Data Files**  
   Use `DATA_v4_churn.csv` as the main input for modeling. Other CSV files are provided for sample runs or as sources for merging and feature engineering.
